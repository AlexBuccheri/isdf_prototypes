# ISDF Prototypes

This project is for prototyping algorithms associated with Inter Separable Density Fitting (ISDF), with the aim of
speeding up the evaluation of two-centre integrals $(ij|kl)$

## Implementation Notes

### Weighted K-means and Finding Interpolation Points

**Issue with My Implementation**
SKLearn implementation does better than my implementation, even without using the k-means++ algorithm for better 
initial guess at the centroids. This suggests that there's an issue in my implementation
 
_**TODO:**_ Debug

SK Learn either uses greedy k-means++ (which I have not yet implemented) or if using random centroids, it runs 10 times
and selects the points that are most optimised.

_**TODO:**_ Either implement greedy k-means++ or have the random seeding algorithm run ~ 10 times and choose the best set of
centroids.

**Implement QD Decomposition as a Reference**
Should also implement QR decomposition for comparison
